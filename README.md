# DIGITAL VLSI SOC DESIGN AND PLANNING
# DAY-1:
## Incepation of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
### How to talk to computers
#### ARDUINO LEONARDO
* Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.The Arduino Leonardo is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32u4. It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.

A processor (CPU) is the logic circuitry that responds to and processes the basic instructions that drive a computer. The CPU is seen as the main and most crucial integrated circuitry (IC) chip in a computer, as it is responsible for interpreting most of computers commands. The purpose of this course is that to know about the designing and planning of the chip mentioned in the above marked circle.
* Processor has interface arround it, those interafaces are:
   * Direcct I2C, direct QSPI, GPIO8-14, PWM4-5,GPIO0-7,PWD0-3
   * JTAG-UART,FTDI,QSPI1-Flash, I2C0-EEPROM
   * VCC/GND, ADC(QSP13), MUXED WITH GPIOs, SDRAM chip.

### Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs
1. QFN-48 Package:
     * A QFN 48 package is a 48-lead, 7x7 mm, leadless, plastic package for integrated circuits with a 0.5 mm pitch.
     * QFN stands for Quad Flat No Lead.
     * These packages are small, low profile, and have a thermal pad for good thermal performance.

2. Chip: It process the data to complete the required task.![Screenshot 2024-04-30 224049](https://github.com/kirankumarmn21/nasscom-vsd-workshop/assets/168124790/0cd0fd6f-f81d-4c14-bcac-de6f90b54800)

3. Pads: It is the thing that can send the signal inside the chip and vice-versa.
4. Core: The area in which all digital logics are present.
5. Die is the boundary around the chip.
